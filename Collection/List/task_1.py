# what is a list ?
# a list is a collection of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers
# lists are ordered, meaning that items have a definite position in the list

l1 = [] #this  is a  empty list 
l2 = [1,2,3,4,5,6] #this is a list 

print(l2) #prints [1,2,3,4,5,6]

# to revese the list we can use reverse inbuilt function to reverse list
l2.reverse()
print(l2) # this is a reversed list
